# FunGaming
A new open-source Flutter project that enables the developer to quickly get started with the Flutter application development. I have created this project and it consists many games like tic tac toe. It is a multiplayer game and It will automatically detect the winner and display it on screen. If there is a draw then it will dectect it and declare it.
